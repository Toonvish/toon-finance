/**
 * Serves the built PWA from the API's own port.
 *
 * This is what makes the Docker image ONE container and ONE origin, and it is
 * why a self-hosted deployment needs no CORS entry, no second web server and
 * no API URL baked into the bundle at build time: the browser fetches `/`,
 * `/api/…` and the PWA assets from the SAME origin, so `PUBLIC_API_URL` can
 * stay empty and the `SameSite=Lax` session cookie is a first-party cookie by
 * construction.
 *
 * Mounted LAST in src/index.ts, and it still refuses `/api/*` itself — belt
 * and braces, because the failure mode of getting that wrong is the SPA shell
 * being returned for an API call, which surfaces as an unparseable JSON error
 * miles from the cause.
 *
 * THE CACHING RULES ARE THE POINT OF THIS FILE. Vite emits content-hashed
 * asset filenames, so those are immutable forever; `index.html`, `sw.js` and
 * the manifest are NOT hashed, and if any of them is cached the app can never
 * update itself again — the browser keeps handing back a service worker that
 * precaches the old bundle. That bug looks like "the server keeps serving a
 * stale app for days", so:
 *
 *   /assets/<name>-<hash>.<ext>   immutable, one year
 *   sw.js, index.html, manifest   no-cache (revalidate every single time)
 *   icons and other static files  one day
