 * `onConflictDoNothing().returning()`, never a SELECT-then-write — two
 * concurrent replays of the same id must not both read "not yet applied".
 *
 * `mutationId` is not a column on `transactions`: the claim also covers
 * PATCH/DELETE, which do not create a new row. For those the caller already
 * knows the target `transactionId`, so it is written into the claim at insert
 * time; for POST it starts `null` and is linked after the row exists (both
 * inside the same `withTransaction`, so a claim is never left dangling).
