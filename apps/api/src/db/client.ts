 * `journal_mode = WAL` is kept from the reference architecture unchanged:
 * readers never block writers, and it is persistent in the FILE (unlike
 * `synchronous`), which is exactly why it belongs here and not in a migration.
 *
 * **`synchronous = FULL`, not `NORMAL` — the one decision this repo makes
 * differently from toon-recipe, and on purpose.** toon-recipe sets `NORMAL`
 * and says why, word for word: *"can lose the last transactions to a power
 * cut, never to a process crash — the right trade for a recipe box, not for a
 * ledger."* toon-finance IS the ledger that sentence is talking about: two
 * people settle real money against the balance this file holds, and the last
 * committed settlement disappearing after a power cut (not a crash — WAL
 * already survives a crash either way) is not a failure mode either of them
 * would accept from a cash book. The measured price (docs/reference-
 * architecture.md §3.2) is about 5 ms per write under `FULL` vs. 0.04 ms
 * under `NORMAL` — real, but a household cash book makes a few dozen writes a
 * day, not a few thousand per second, so it is unmeasurable in practice.
 *
 * `synchronous` is PER-CONNECTION (unlike `journal_mode`), so a connection
 * that skipped this would silently fall back to the libSQL default (also
 * `FULL`, so the failure mode of forgetting this line is "slow", never
 * "wrong") — this comment exists so nobody "optimises" it back to `NORMAL`
 * without re-reading the trade-off above.
