/**
 * [OFFLINE] — the replay-protection ledger itself (docs/spec.md §2.9,
 * CLAUDE.md gotcha #9/#10, ledger-spec.md §4.4).
 *
 * `transactions.test.ts` and `settlements.test.ts` already prove the *happy*
 * path end-to-end (a replayed `mutationId` on `POST` answers 200 instead of
 * booking twice). This file owns what those integration tests do not cover:
 *
 *  1. `claimMutation` at the service level, directly, including the PATCH/
 *     DELETE shape (an ALREADY-KNOWN `transactionId`, never a fresh one).
 *  2. The race the doc comment on `claimMutation` calls out by name: two
 *     concurrent deliveries of the SAME `mutationId` — the whole reason the
 *     claim is `INSERT … ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`, never `SELECT`-then-write.
 *     A `SELECT`-then-write implementation would let both callers read
 *     "not yet applied" and both apply — this test is what would catch that
 *     regression.
 *  3. `pruneMutationClaims`'s TTL boundary.
 *  4. The gap this task found and closed: `deleteTransaction` used to check
 *     `mutationId` AFTER loading the row, so a replay delivered after the
 *     row was already gone by the FIRST delivery 404'd instead of answering
 *     204 — see `peekMutationClaim` in `services/ledger/idempotency.ts`.
 *
 * The "pure parts of the queue logic" half of this task's test plan is
 * `apps/web/src/lib/persist.test.ts` (`shouldPersistMutation`) — it already
 * covers what the CLIENT decides is worth persisting; this file covers what
 * the SERVER does when a persisted mutation is finally delivered, once or
 * twice.
