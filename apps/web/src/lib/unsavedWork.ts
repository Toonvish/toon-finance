/**
 * "Is there work on screen that a reload would throw away?"
 *
 * One counter, module-level, so the answer is available OUTSIDE React — the
 * service-worker update policy in `./pwa.ts` needs it in an event handler,
 * not in a render. A counter rather than a boolean because two screens can be
 * dirty at once (the "Erfassen" form behind an open dialog), and the last one
 * to finish must not clear the flag for the other.
 *
 * The only reader today is the update policy: an app update reloads the
 * document, so it waits while this is true and `UpdateBanner` offers the
 * reload instead.
 *
 * A queued transaction mutation is NOT unsaved work: it lives in IndexedDB
 * and is replayed after a reload (`lib/persist.ts`, [OFFLINE]), and its
 * client-minted `mutationId` makes a double delivery a no-op. Only in-memory
 * edits count.
